## Goal

The goal is to create flippable cards. The flip animation will be achieved via animating the `rect_scale.x` to a near zero value; change of texture; and animating the `rect_scale.x` value back to 1.

Make 2 cards. One flippable via a button close-by; and another card that can itslef be clicked to flip.
